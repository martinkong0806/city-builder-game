There are several changes compared from the original projects
- Road models are changed so the road now covers the whole tile.
- Cars models are changed to fit the theme of roads
- Cars can now only spawn from the end of the roads
- Cars will not disappear mid way and will travel to any end of road instead.
- Map tiles changes from 16x16 to 17x17
- A straight road in the middle is created as the starting map.

## How do I run this locally?
